## 🧠 Smart Insights Logic

### Algorithm Overview

```javascript
1. Analyze completion patterns (last 7-14 days)
2. Calculate success rates per habit
3. Identify peak performance times
4. Detect streak risks (last completion date)
5. Evaluate category strengths
6. Check for overload (>10 habits)
7. Generate suggestions based on patterns
8. Prioritize by urgency (1-5 scale)
9. Return top 5 insights
```

### Insight Priorities

- **5:** Urgent (streak at risk)
- **4:** Warning (overload)
- **3:** Attention (struggling habit)
- **2:** Insight (patterns, suggestions)
- **1:** Positive (celebrations)
